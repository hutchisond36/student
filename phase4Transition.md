# The Transition phase

The last of four phases in our project management process is called Transition. 

1. Inception was concerned with risks related to the project's **objectives**, or *what* we are trying to do. 
2. Elaboration was concerned with risks related to the project's **approach**, or *how* we will do it. 
3. Construction was concerned with risks to the project's **execution**, or *getting it done*.
4. Transition is concerned with risks to the project's **pay off**, or *getting the value*.

For system development projects, Transition involves the delivery of the system and the ongoing operations and maintenance.

In this context, you need to:

- "publish" your work in some public space
- announce this "publication" to external audience(s) who might be interested
- request feedback from these audiences, and respond appropriately

In an organizational setting, the Transition phase is everything from the delivery/deployment of the system to the time that it is shut down, retired, or replaced. It includes ongoing training of user and support staff, fixing problems, operational tasks like backups and tool upgrades, and much more.

In this course, the Transition phase is meant to demonstrate your learning to, and promote communication with, interested people beyond the computer science program and beyond the college, including employers and graduate schools. 

Because this is the "final" phase, there is no stakeholder review for transitioning to a next phase.
