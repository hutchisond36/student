# The Construction phase

The third of four phases in our project management process is called Construction. 

1. Inception was concerned with risks related to the project's **objectives**, or *what* we are trying to do. 
2. Elaboration was concerned with risks related to the project's **approach**, or *how* we will do it. 
3. Construction is concerned with risks to the project's **execution**, or *getting it done*.

For system development projects, Construction concentrates on creating everything needed to deliver a system that meets stakeholder win conditions.

In this context, you need to gather and record information showing that you have:

- created code that meets objectives
- recorded evidence that the code is of appropriate quality
- "packaged" these materials in a form that is appropriate to share with outside audiences
- satisfied relevant legal and ethical requirements

In an organizational setting, the Construction phase is the proper time to "ramp up" staffing-- allocating many people to execute the plan. In addition to coding software, systems development projects must address training, support, operations, and maintenance needs.

In this course, the Construction phase includes writing code to show that you have satisfied the syllabus Learning Outcomes; this is one of the instructor's win conditions. But it is more than that. It includes gathering evidence about the code's quality, and "packaging" these materials in a way that can be shared with outside audiences.

Some of this will be recorded in your portfolio file. Beyond that, it will be up to you to decide what form this work takes.

## Stakeholder review decisions

<!-- Periodically, success-critical stakeholders meet to review project status and select one of three options for the project's future. The number of these review meetings will vary by project and phase, so the subsection described below may need to be repeated-- once per review meeting. Do not remove the following instructions comments until the final review meeting for this phase is complete. -->

### <!--meeting date --> 

<!-- Remove two of the following three statements, leaving the one that describes the stakeholders' decision.
.
All success-critical stakeholders agreed to spend no more resources and end the project, because the risks to achieving a win-win outcome are too high.
.
All success-critical stakeholders agreed to commit a higher level of resources and move to the next phase, because this phase's list of risks to achieving a win-win outcome are at an acceptable level.
.
All success-critical stakeholders agreed to continue spending resources at the same level and remain in the this phase, gathering more information for future consideration. -->
