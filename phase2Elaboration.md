# The Elaboration phase

The second of four phases in our project management process is called Elaboration. 

1. Inception was concerned with risks related to the project's **objectives**, or *what* we are trying to do. 
2. Elaboration is concerned with risks related to the project's **approach**, or *how* we will do it. 

For system development projects, Elaboration concentrates on “architecturally significant” decisions that ripple
through the entire system. For example, decisions about operating systems, databases, development tools, login and security approaches, etc. 

In this context, you need to gather and record information showing that you:

- have an integrated, *working* set of hardware and software tools that support the objectives of the project; and
- can deliver a cost-effective solution within the window of opportunity.

In a professional setting, the window of opportunity for a system may be limited. For example, updated tax prep software is not worth much after the tax filing deadlines have passed. 

To minimize risk, an organization should increase the resources that were allocated in the project's Inception phase *just enough* to gather the information needed in the Elaboration phase. A common mistake is to rush many people onto the project before there is a clear approach that supports productive cooperation.

In this course, the Elaboration phase involves deciding on the tools that you will use, and recording evidence that you can learn and use them to get the job done in the time available.

## Hardware to be used

### In the classroom



### Outside the classroom



## Software to be used



## Learning resources

<!-- Completing a project may require learning new tools and techniques. This is sometimes true in a professional setting, and often true in an educational setting.
.
First, list the books, Web sites, experts, etc. that you will use to learn what you need to for this project.
.
Second, explain why you have confidence that this will work. In other words, why should we think that the risk is low/chance of success is high?
.
Then remove this instructions comment. -->

## Stakeholder review decisions

<!-- Periodically, success-critical stakeholders meet to review project status and select one of three options for the project's future. The number of these review meetings will vary by project and phase, so the subsection described below may need to be repeated-- once per review meeting. Do not remove the following instructions comments until the final review meeting for this phase is complete. -->

### <!--meeting date --> 

<!-- Remove two of the following three statements, leaving the one that describes the stakeholders' decision.
.
All success-critical stakeholders agreed to spend no more resources and end the project, because the risks to achieving a win-win outcome are too high.
.
All success-critical stakeholders agreed to commit a higher level of resources and move to the next phase, because this phase's list of risks to achieving a win-win outcome are at an acceptable level.
.
All success-critical stakeholders agreed to continue spending resources at the same level and remain in the this phase, gathering more information for future consideration. -->
