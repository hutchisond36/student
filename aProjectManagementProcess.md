# A project management process

This class will introduce you to a process for managing projects. 

Think of yourself as a project manager, where the project is for you to successfully complete this course. (Notice that this is different from the more common idea that some course assignments are projects. *We will think of this entire course as one project.*) 

## Project stakeholders

Any non-trivial project has many stakeholders-- people and groups who have some interest in the project. Take a moment to brainstorm all the stakeholders for your project of completing this class.

As the student, you are a stakeholder. Your instructor is one, too. Other stakeholders include the college's administration, students, and employees; whomever is paying your tuition; your future employers, clients, and customers; and society at large.

That's a lot of stakeholders. But some are more immediately relevant that others. While many people have some indirect interest in project results, only a subset will directly decide if the project is a success. We call these the **success-critical stakeholders**. 

For this course, the success-critical stakeholders are the student and the instructor. Between us, we can decide the project's success. We will represent the indirect interest of other stakeholders as needed.

## Project success

What does it take for a stakeholder to decide that project results are a "win" for that stakeholder? These are the stakeholder's **win conditions**. Obviously, they differ from one stakeholder and one project to another.

A successful project is a project that:

1. satisfies the win conditions of all success-critical stakeholders, ***or*** 
2. consumes minimal resources to decide that these conditions cannot be satisfied.

The first part of the definition describes "win-win" outcomes. Often, critical stakeholders who are less involved or less influential do not feel a "win" from supposedly successful projects. These "win-lose" outcomes often appear as problems late in the project, or after it is "complete".  

The second part of the definition recognizes that projects start with many unknowns. Sometimes we learn that our chances of a win-win outcome are not good. In these cases it is best to learn this as quickly and cheaply as possible, and end the project. A poker player *should* fold a poor hand-- it is smart to stop spending on an outcome that is unlikely to "win". 

## Succeeding by reducing risk

A **risk** is anything that reduces the chance of project success. Our project management process is a risk-driven sequence of four phases. Each phase identifies a specific set of risks that the project must address in that phase. 

1. The Inception phase targets risks related to the project's **objectives**, or *what* we are trying to do. 
2. The Elaboration phase targets risks related to the project's **approach**, or *how* we will do it. 
3. The Construction phase targets risks to the project's **execution**, or *getting it done*.
4. The Transition phase targets risks to the project's **pay off**, or *getting the value* from our investment.

You must gather and record information about those risks' impact on your project, and how your project has addressed or will address those risks. 

Periodically, the success-critical stakeholders meet to review this information and choose one of three actions.

1. spend no more resources and end the project, because the risks to achieving a win-win outcome are too high; ***or***
2. start spending resources at a higher level and move to the next phase, because the risks to achieving a win-win outcome are low enough; ***or***
3. continue spending resources at the same level and remain in the current phase, because we need more information in order to choose 1 or 2 above. 

Projects that complete all four phases reduce the risk of failure to zero by actually satisfying the win conditions of all critical stakeholders. This is part 1 of our success definition.

Other projects will invest minimal time and effort to discover that the risks to a win-win are too high: sometimes it is impossible to satisfy all win conditions, costs too much, or is unwise to try. These projects end without completing all phases, when stakeholders agree to action 1 above. This is part 2 of our success definition.
